<p> Time has passed since I saw you
Thoughts of you are stronger now
And the distance is painful
Your face still in my soul

I search your eyes in twinkling stars
And your smile in the moon
Hopes in my heart
Getting stronger to see you soon

I talk to you in my dreams
My arms wide open for you
Your touch feels so soft and real
I don't want to wake up

I promise I will see you again
The world through your eyes I see
You can take my hand if you wish 
And I will let you kiss me!</p>

<p>Feelings

Feelings 
Soft as touch of a feather
Fragile as petals of a flower
Beautiful as colours of evening sky!

Give them the sky of love
 the wings of trust and hope
And let them fly free and high 
Like a butterfly 

Let them spread the colors of joy
And float like a dream
Race with the wind
Not a moment of grim

If a black cloud comes in the way
Do not lose your heart
Give your wings fuel of faith
Remember the sky is your canvas!

Moons in Your Eyes!

I look up at the dark sky
A thousand stars smile at once
Their Sparkling undeniable light 
Illuminate my face like thousand suns!

The moons in your eyes, full and bright
Look in mine with hope and light
The secrets they share, deep and dark
Their songs give rise to a thousand spark

The love between them one of a kind
Pure and strong, silly and wild
No word is enough to express
And The world stands still

They are full of promise of today
And the boundless love of tomorrow
Of priceless memories we make
There will be no place for sorrow

The moons of your eyes
Bless me with miracle called hope
And make me fall in love 
With dreams and bliss of togetherness

The moons of your eyes
My motivation, my strength
Guiding me into beautiful future 
They are my sanity, my happy place!
